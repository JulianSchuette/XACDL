{"name":"XACDL","tagline":"eXtensible Access Control Domain Language - a DSL for XACML","body":"# What is it?\r\n\r\nXACDL is a textual DSL for writing XACML policies and requests. It is developed using Xtext.\r\n\r\n# Why?\r\n\r\nI had to write a lot of fairly simple XACML policies, and even more XACML requests. Doing it \"manually\" is boring and error-prone. I didn't like the GUI or web-based tools I could find either, because of their limitations and/or the need to use a mouse all the time. So I created my own DSL.\r\n\r\n# Limitations?\r\n\r\nXACDL doesn't support the whole XACML standard, far from it. I'm adding new features as I need them, but contributions are of course very welcome.\r\n\r\n# Will my XACDL policies and request be compatible with future releases?\r\n\r\nNot before I release version 1.0 (which may or may not ever happen). I'm still playing around with the language to find what works best, so expect quite a lot of changes for now.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
